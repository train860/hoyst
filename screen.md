立即，同一行的 “Status” 状态单元格从 “Draft” 变为 “Publishing... ⏳”。

3. 问题区域 (The Problem Section)
Headline (标题):

Blogging Shouldn't Be This Complicated.

(写博客，本不该如此复杂。)

Content (内容，使用对比格式):

Your ideas live in Notion. Your published posts live somewhere else. The constant context-switching, copy-pasting, and reformatting is killing your creative flow.

✗ The Disconnected Workflow: Jumping between Notion for writing, WordPress/Ghost for publishing, and your code editor for tweaks.
✓ A Single Source of Truth: Write, manage, and publish your entire blog from one place: your Notion database.

✗ Scattered Conversations: Managing reader comments on your blog, and post ideas back in Notion.
✓ Unified Engagement: Reader comments sync directly to your Notion page. Manage all feedback where your content lives.

✗ Generic & Slow: Using a platform that makes your blog look like everyone else's and loads at a crawl.
✓ Uniquely Yours & Blazing-Fast: A blog that reflects your brand and keeps readers engaged with incredible speed.

3. Just. Click. Publish.
To publish an article, just click the "Publish" button in your database. That's it. We build your site, and a few moments later, the live URL appears right back in your Notion table. The loop is closed.

5. 设计与定制区域 (The "Design" Section)
Headline (主标题):

Go Beyond Templates. Define Your Brand.

(超越模板，定义你的品牌。)

Fine-tune every detail—from global color palettes and typography to layout spacing and code block styles. Build a truly custom, professional blog that stands out, without ever wrestling with CSS.

(别再满足于那种一眼就能看出是“模板搭建”的博客了。我们强大的，类似 Shopify 的可视化编辑器，会把设计的钥匙交到你手中。精细调整每一个细节——从全局调色板、字体搭配，到布局间距和代码块样式。无需和 CSS 搏斗，你就能构建一个真正定制化、能彰显品牌个性的专业博客。)

Visual (视觉):

一张大尺寸的、清晰的截图或 GIF，展示可视化主题编辑器的强大界面。左侧是为博客优化的设置选项（字体搭配、阅读宽度、代码高亮主题等），右侧是一个排版精美的博客文章在进行实时预览。这个视觉必须能瞬间传达出“强大”和“高掌控度”的感觉。
